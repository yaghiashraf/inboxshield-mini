# Development Notes

## Payment Flow Fix

The payment flow has been updated to work with mock data in development mode since Netlify functions don't run properly in Next.js dev server.

### Current Development Flow:
1. User scans domain (uses real DNS analysis from `/netlify/functions/check-preview`)
2. Payment button redirects to Stripe payment link
3. Success page generates mock report data for testing
4. Report page displays mock comprehensive analysis

### Production Flow:
In production, update the following functions to use real DNS analysis:

#### Success Page (`src/app/success/page.tsx`):
Replace the `generateReport` function to use:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/generate-full-report', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ domain: domainName, paymentVerified: true })
});
```

#### Report Page (`src/app/report/[reportId]/page.tsx`):
Replace the `generateReportFromPaymentLink` function to use:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/.netlify/functions/check-full', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ domain: domain })
});
```

### Testing Payment Flow:
1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Enter any domain (e.g., "test.com")
3. Click "Get Complete Fix Guide - $11.99"
4. You'll be redirected to the Stripe payment link
5. Complete payment with test card
6. Should redirect back to success page and show mock report
7. Will redirect to report page with full mock analysis

The mock data shows failed DNS configurations to demonstrate the complete user experience.
